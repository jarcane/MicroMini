</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
The MicroMini is a virtual stack machine inspired by classic minicomputers. It is written in Racket, an excellent Scheme-derived Lisp with a specialty in teaching and new language development. MicroMini is purely stack based: other than memory calls, almost all operations take no arguments, collecting their required operands from the top of the stack. 
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-1.1">1.1</a> Specifications
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
The MicroMini is patterned after an imaginary vintage minicomputer, scaled down to home-size. As such, it’s basic specifications are thus kept within those limits, save that at present, the device runs at the full speed of the user’s computer rather than an artificially limited operation speed.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-1.2">1.2</a> Usage and Requirements
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
At this time, MicroMini only runs on Unix-derived operating systems which provide <i>stty. </i>Future implementations may correct this, however as it stands, there are no Racket libs for Windows platforms which can correctly handle the TRMI and TRMO instructions.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If running the binary, you need only invoke it from the command line, like so:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">mmini &lt;mm-binary-file&gt;
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
Where <i>mm-binary-file </i>is the filename of a previously created binary file composed of 8-bit bytes of MicroMini machine code. Currently there is no compiler or assembler available for MicroMini, but the author intends to create one soon.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If you wish to run MicroMini from the source, you will need to install Racket. The program was created with Racket 6.1, and the author can make no guarantees about backwards compatibility. To install and invoke it, you can do:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">&gt; git clone https://github.com/jarcane/MicroMini.git
&gt; cd ./MicroMini
&gt; racket main.rkt &lt;mm-binary-file&gt;
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
Where, as before, <i>mm-binary-file </i>is a previously created MM binary.
</div>

<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-2">2</a> MicroMini Operation
</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
On invocation, MicroMini will take the target file, read it byte by byte into memory, and begin executing from address #x0000. It will continue to run through valid instructions until it reaches the end of the RAM bank, it is given a HLT instruction, or there is an error. I/O at this point comes purely via terminal, handled via the TRMI and TRMO instructions.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Each cycle, the MicroMini:
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Executes the instruction found at the address designated by the program counter
</li>
<li>
Increments the program pointer by 1
</li>
<li>
Checks if the program pointer has reached the end of ram space and, if so, sets the halt-bit
</li>
<li>
Checks the cycle counter:<ol>
<li>
If full, resets to 0
</li>
<li>
If not, increments by 1
</li>

</ol>

</li>
<li>
Checks the halt-bit, and stops execution if set
</li>

</ol>

<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-3">3</a> MicroMini Instructions
</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
The following are the standard instructions currently implemented in MicroMini, with descriptions of their operation. 
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3.1">3.1</a> #x00 NOP - No OPeration

<div class="Unindented">
Does nothing, and will be skipped by the processor.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3.2">3.2</a> #x01 HLT - HaLT
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3.3">3.3</a> #x02 DATA <i>num</i>
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">

</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3.4">3.4</a> #x10 ADD
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">

<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3.5">3.5</a> #x20 SUB
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Pops the top two values in the stack, subtracts the top value from the one below it, and pushes the result to the stack. If there is an underflow, the carry-bit is set.

<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3.6">3.6</a> #x30 AND

<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3.10">3.10</a> #x40 EQ? - EQual?
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Pops the top two values from the stack, and compares them. If they are equal, pushes 0x01 to the stack. If not equal, pushes 0x00.

</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Pops the top two values from the stack, and compares the top value to the one below it. If the top value is lesser, pushes 0x01 to the stack. If the top value is greater, pushes 0x00 to the stack.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3.15">3.15</a> #x60 POP
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">

</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3.16">3.16</a> #x61 POTA <i>address - </i>POp To Address

</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3.17">3.17</a> #x70 JMP <i>address - </i>JuMP
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">

</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Stores the current program pointer (skipping itself) to the return pointer, consumes the next two bytes as an address location, then sets the program pointer to continue execution at that address on the next cycle. Note that the return pointer does not actually point to the original location, but rather the location just past the original JSR instruction and its address, in order to prevent unbreakable loops.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3.19">3.19</a> #x72 JIF <i>address - </i>Jump IF
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Pops the top value of the stack. If it is 0x01, it consumes the next two bytes as an address, then sets the program pointer to continue execution from that address on the next cycle. Otherwise, it skips the next two bytes (to avoid attempting to execute the address values), but otherwise does nothing.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3.20">3.20</a> #x73 RET - Return
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Sets the program pointer equal to the return pointer, thus causing the CPU to resume execution just past the original JSR on the next cycle.
</div>

</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Pops the top value of the stack, and sends the byte to the terminal as output.
